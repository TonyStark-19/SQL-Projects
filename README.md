## 📌 Project 1: Student Management System

This project is a fully functional SQL-based Student Management System, created using MySQL. It includes table definitions, relationships using foreign keys, data insertion, and a wide range of SQL queries for practice and insights.

### 🔧 Tables

- `student` – Basic student details like name, city, DOB, etc.
- `course` – Course information with credits and instructor mapping.
- `instructor` – Instructor details and departments.
- `enrollment` – Tracks which student is enrolled in which course and their grade.

### 📊 Key Features

- ER Model using foreign keys.
- Queries for filtering, joining, grouping, and aggregating.
- Data insights like student performance, course popularity, and instructor-course mapping.
- Covers practical use cases such as:
  - Age calculation using `DOB`
  - Students not enrolled in any course
  - Course-wise grade averages

### 📄 Total Queries: 16+

- Example:
  - List students with Grade A
  - Find average grade per course
  - Join to display student → course → instructor
